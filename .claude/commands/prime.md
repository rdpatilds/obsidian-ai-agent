1. **Project Purpose**: What this application does
2. **Architecture**: Key patterns (vertical slice, FastAPI + Pydantic AI)
3. **Core Principles**: TYPE SAFETY, KISS, YAGNI
4. **Tech Stack**: Main dependencies and tools
5. **Key Requirements**: Logging, testing, type annotations
6. **Current State**: What's implemented
